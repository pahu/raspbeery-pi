Homebrew automation with a Raspberry Pi

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pahu/toroi-pi/blob/master/docs/Screenshot01.png)

This is a hobby Raspberry Pi project that I'm writing/building to control the temperature of my fermentation fridge and mash tun/kettle in an electric brew system. 

To run on port 6100

export FLASK_APP=app.py

flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=6100
